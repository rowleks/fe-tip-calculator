## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt more about HTML forms and form validation.

I also learnt more about JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulations

### Continued development

I'll continue practicing to get better with JavaScript form validations and error handling and also get better with using CSS grid.

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) - This helped me understand event handlers in JavaScript better
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dom-manipulation-in-javascript/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand DOM traversals and manipulations
